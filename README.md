# EmergingTechnologies

# Tasks & Project
This repository is for Emerging Technologies, where we study the use of Quantum Computing as an emerging technology.  

**By Owen Casey**

# Prerequisites
The main contents of this repository are Jupyter notebooks. To run these notebooks, you will need the following:

**Python**: Downloading the most recent version of Python is recommended. You can download python from the official Python site [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). However, I recommend installing Python through [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), as it provides an all in one installation and management for Python. 
- Miniconda (Recommended): Minimal installer, low storage usage
- Anaconda: Full installer, high storage usage 

**Jupyter Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook support should come with Anaconda/Miniconda, but you can also install it through a VSCode extension.

**Required Libraries**: Any required libraries will be mentioned in the relevant section they are used in the notebooks. 

# Tasks

## Overview
**Task 1: Collatz Conjuncture**
This task covers the famous unsolved Collatz Conjuncutre problem through Python.

**Task 2: Square Roots**
This task covers square roots in Python through Newtons method. 

**Task 3: Four Bit Functions**
This task covers a function that takes four input bits.

**Task 4: Matrix Multiplication**
This task covers matrix multiplication in Python.

# Project

## Overview
The project covers Deutsch's Algorithm, which is a foundational algorithm in quantum computing. The algorithm is the first representation of quantum advantage, which is when a quantum computer has an advantage over a classical computer. The project introduces quantum computing and gives a detailed explanation on all of the essential components for understanding and implementing Deutsch's algorithm.
