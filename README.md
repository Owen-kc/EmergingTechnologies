# EmergingTechnologies

# Tasks & Project
This repository is for Emerging Technologies, where we study the use of Quantum Computing as an emerging technology.  

**By Owen Casey**

# Prerequisites
The main contents of this repository are Jupyter notebooks. To run these notebooks, you will need the following:

**Python**: Downloading the most recent version of Python is recommended. You can download python from the official Python site [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). However, I recommend installing Python through [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), as it provides an all in one installation and management for Python. 
- Miniconda (Recommended): Minimal installer, low storage usage
- Anaconda: Full installer, high storage usage 

**Jupyter Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook support should come with Anaconda/Miniconda, but you can also install it through a VSCode extension.

**Required Libraries**: Any required libraries will be mentioned in the relevant section they are used in the notebooks. 

# How to run

This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up and run the Jupyter notebooks

## Step 1: Install Python
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install it through the methods I outlined above.

## Step 2: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Owen-kc/EmergingTechnologies.git
```

## Step 3: Install required libraries
The relevant libraries will be defined in the notebooks, ensure these are installed for the notebooks to run properly. 

## Step 4: Run Jupyter Notebook
If you have installed Anaconda or Miniconda, Jupyter Notebook should already be installed. Otherwise, install it using the following command:

```
pip install notebook
```
or you can install it through the VSCode extension.

## Step 5: Start Jupyter notebook

You can start the jupyter notebook you can run the following command:
```
jupyter notebook
```
You can use this command to open a specific notebook, so navigate to the notebook you want to run and execute the command to open the notebook in the jupyter interface.


By following these steps, you should be able to run the contents of the repository.

# Tasks

## Overview
**Task 1: Collatz Conjuncture**
This task covers the famous unsolved Collatz Conjuncutre problem through Python.

**Task 2: Square Roots**
This task covers square roots in Python through Newtons method. 

**Task 3: Four Bit Functions**
This task covers a function that takes four input bits.

**Task 4: Matrix Multiplication**
This task covers matrix multiplication in Python.

# Project

## Overview
The project covers Deutsch's Algorithm, which is a foundational algorithm in quantum computing. The algorithm is the first representation of quantum advantage, which is when a quantum computer has an advantage over a classical computer. The project introduces quantum computing and gives a detailed explanation on all of the essential components for understanding and implementing Deutsch's algorithm.
